# Overview

As a software engineer, I am trying to further my learning by creating interactive, dynamic web applications using JavaScript. This project helped me understand how to manage user interaction, handle errors, manipulate arrays, and create fun and engaging content on the browser.

I wrote a browser-based **Spearfishing Adventure Game** where players make choices while exploring the ocean, encountering reefs, sharks, and hidden coves. The adventure has multiple paths, random encounters, and various endings, all implemented with JavaScript and enhanced with CSS animations.

The purpose of writing this software was to practice:  
- Displaying output to the screen using the DOM  
- ES6 array methods (`forEach`, `filter`, `join`)  
- Recursion through function calls to manage adventure flow  
- Using an external library (Lodash)  
- Creating styled DOM structures with CSS for visual effects

# Development Environment

**Tools used:**  
- Visual Studio Code for coding and editing  
- Google Chrome for running the project  
- Lodash library via CDN for array manipulation and randomness

**Programming Language and Libraries:**  
- JavaScript (ES6) for all logic and interactivity  
- HTML/CSS for DOM structure and styling  
- Lodash for random selection and joining arrays

# Future Work

- Add more storylines and endings 
- Add a score at the end with fish caught
- Include sound effects or music 
- Add images to the choices for better presentation
